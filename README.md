# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## WARNING
**this is my first React.js project, and my focus on implimenting the functionality and as such, the styling (scss + css) of this web app is both terrible and incomplete (hover and active states). The focus is on React.js features.**

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

**I used React.js for this project though**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (I didn't impliment this. Just trying out ideas in React.js)
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Filtering

#### Option 1

Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML `data-` attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the [index.html](./index.html) file.

The categories are:

- Role: Frontend, Backend, Fullstack
- Level: Junior, Midweight, Senior
- Languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: React, Sass, Vue, Django, RoR (Ruby on Rails)

So, if a job listing is for has the following categories `Frontend, Junior, JavaScript, React` your HTML data attributes would look like this `data-role="frontend" data-level="junior" data-languages="javascript" data-tools="react"`.

#### Option 2

Use the [data.json](./data.json) file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte. (My implimentation)

To add a filter, the user needs to click on the tablets on the right-side of the listing on desktop or the bottom on mobile. For each filter added, only listings containing all selected filters should be returned.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
